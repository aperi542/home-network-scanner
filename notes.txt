DAY 1 - December 30, 2025

What I built today:
- Created a Python network scanner that finds devices on my home network
- Successfully scanned my network and found 3 active devices

What I learned:
- How IP addresses and MAC addresses work
- How ARP requests discover devices on a network
- How to use the scapy library in Python
- How to use Git and GitHub for version control
- Basic Terminal/command line skills

Technical skills used:
- Python programming
- Network protocols (ARP)
- Git version control
- Mac Terminal

What's working:
- Scanner successfully finds active devices
- Shows IP and MAC addresses for each device

What I'll add next (Jan 5):
- Vendor lookup using MAC address prefixes
- Device categorization (mobile, computer, IoT, etc.)
- Better formatted output
- Security insights

Time spent: ~1 hour
